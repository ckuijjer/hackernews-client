    "text": "Hey everyone!<p>In the last months I&#x27;ve been working on Unclutter, a modern reader mode browser extension. In contrast to all existing approaches, it unclutters articles by modifying their CSS instead of extracting the text content.<p>This results in a more visually pleasing result that reuses the original article style. The idea is to remove friction so you use the reader mode more often.\nThere are a few more features around saving articles automatically and taking highlights -- more details are on the website.<p>The extension has about 400 active weekly users right now, mostly from organic web store traffic. Monetisation has proven to be hard and for freemium there would need to be much higher numbers anyways.\nDo you think I should keep working on the project?",

    "title": "Launch HN: Kalshi (YC W19) – A regulated exchange for trading on events",
    "text": "Hi HN! Tarek and Luana here, co-founders of Kalshi (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kalshi.com&#x2F;hn\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kalshi.com&#x2F;hn</a>), a financial exchange that allows you to trade on the outcome of events.<p>Everyone faces different risks: inflation, extreme weather, mortgage rates, Supreme Court decisions, student debt, and more. Our mission is to allow people and businesses to mitigate risks that relate to them.<p>We got into finance early during our time at MIT. Tarek worked at Goldman and Citadel, Luana worked at Bridgewater and Citadel. We noticed something common across all these places: a lot of trading stemmed from an opinion on a future event. For example, a lot of activity at Goldman at the time was focused on providing institutions with exposure to, or a hedge against, Brexit. To do this, we’d sell them complicated financial bundles (a bunch of swaps, options, etc.) at a high price… but these bundles were proxies: basically, a bunch of risk curves fitted together to approximate the binary&#x2F;event exposure the customers were looking for. What you couldn’t do was just trade directly on the event itself, even though that would have been simpler and cheaper and was what people actually wanted. The option just didn’t exist.<p>Once we identified the problem, we noticed it everywhere. The more we thought about it, the more the idea of an exchange for people to trade directly on events seemed obvious. That was the inspiration for Kalshi’s event contracts.<p>We give people the ability to trade based on their opinions about a specific yes-or-no question. For example, if you have student debt and are worried about relief not passing, you can purchase a contract and get a payout even if it doesn’t pass. If you’re worried about the economic fallout of another lockdown, you can place a trade to hedge against it. If you’ve developed a model on inflation, you can profit from that….and maybe even offset your rising costs.<p>Our markets are phrased as simple yes&#x2F;no questions. For example, “Will the Fed raise interest rates next month?”. Users place orders on either the Yes or the No side and choose a price to purchase the contract between 1c and 99c. When there is a Yes order and a No order on both sides where the prices sum to $1, a trade is formed. When the event happens or doesn’t happen, based on criteria clearly defined in our contracts up front, we give back that $1 to whoever was right. The way our markets are structured means these trades are fully collateralized—there’s no margin or leverage on our platform.<p>The price that a given event contract trades at is actually the market’s assessment of the probability that the event will happen. If something happens that should increase the probability, people will start paying more for Yes contracts, raising the price. This market determination of the likelihood of an event has made Kalshi the most accurate place for predicting where inflation will be next month: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kalshi.com&#x2F;forecasts&#x2F;inflation\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kalshi.com&#x2F;forecasts&#x2F;inflation</a>. People have been building forecasting dashboards on all sorts of things based on our data, including Bloomberg and news outlets.<p>Before Kalshi, markets that allowed you to trade on economically relevant events were illegal or unregulated. From day 1, we decided to take the harder path: build a fully regulated exchange with a deep commitment to compliance. We spent almost 3 years working with the CFTC to develop our exchange, contracts, market structure, surveillance, and compliance programs to provide a safe, secure and orderly market. This finally led to us getting federal approval to launch the first regulated exchange for this new asset class.<p>This path incurred the risk of launching later than anyone who opted to eschew regulatory approval. We chose the hard path because we want to develop this asset class in a way that is safe and responsible, which we see as the only way to build for the long term. We make money the way most exchanges do: we take a small fee on each transaction on our platform (none of the weird order flow or other stuff).<p>Our markets are liquid, have been around for over a year now, are fully regulated (as mentioned), and expanding. We’ve got over 70 markets live, many inspired by requests from our users. Here are some of the markets we’ve had so far: Will there be a Moon landing by 2025? [1] What will monthly inflation be? [2] Will there be a recession in 2023? [3] Will a new COVID variant of concern be identified? [4] We’d love to hear your suggestions for others!<p>You can access our platform through the web, iOS, Android, and our API - you can sign up at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kalshi.com&#x2F;hn\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kalshi.com&#x2F;hn</a> and place your first trade in minutes.

The device is able to read, copy, and emulate radio-frequency (RFID) tags, radio remotes, and digital access keys.[2] It was first announced in August 2020 through the Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign, which raised $4.8M.[3] The first devices were delivered to backers 18 months after completion of the crowdfunding campaign.<p>Flipper Zero is designed for interaction with various types of access control systems, radio protocols, RFID, near-field communication (NFC), and infrared signals.[5][6] To operate the device, it is not required to have a computer or a smartphone — it can be controlled via a 5-position D-pad and a separate back button. Flipper Zero has a monochrome orange backlight LCD screen with a resolution of 128x64 pixels. For connection with external modules, the device has general-purpose input&#x2F;output (GPIO) pinholes on the top side. User data and firmware updates are stored on a Micro SD card.

    "text": "I have a situation: one of my developers is now in Ukraine working remotely. She is in a relatively safe area near a nuclear power plant, which so far has not been targeted by Russian missile strikes and was producing electricity for her town. Today it was shut down, meaning also no water etc in her apartment. Local cellular network is still working, meaning that she has Internet connection.<p>For some personal reasons she is not ready to evacuate, I also do not want to terminate the contract if there’s a chance that she can work even in such difficult circumstances. We are getting used to the sound of air raid sirens during meetings, but this is new and we have to find a way to maintain the working process during the coming winter.<p>What would you do in this situation? \nWhat inexpensive technology can help here to survive this madness? Are there any advices that you would give?",

    "text": "Hello HN, I&#x27;m building a SaaS product. Each tenant can have their own database structure&#x2F;fields while many tables are common between the tenants.  \nFor example table A is common for all of them while table B might have different fields upon organization&#x2F;tenant&#x27;s need, in other words we have table B for all orgs with different fields.<p>I&#x27;m thinking of  shared-codebase and shared-database paradigm for it&#x27;s simplicity(no synchronization needed).  Have you encountered this situation? Is it possible&#x2F;and how to handle this objective with single database for all tenants? Further, I&#x27;m using PostgreSQL database.<p>Thanks in advance.",

    "text": "I mess around with writing sometimes and I was just gazing at some pics of a PDP-8 - so gorgeous, and clearly the real world inspiration for all the &quot;panel of blinking lights&quot; computers we watched in 70s-80s SF.<p>Got me wondering - we&#x27;ve had way too many shows now dealing with modern digital culture (hello Silicon Valley). There&#x27;s been some attempts to tell stories from the early days of <i>micro</i>computers (Halt And Catch Fire for instance), and that makes sense, given that those are the machines that many GenX played with at home or at school.<p>But Hollywood&#x27;s version of Silicon Valley - Silvercon Valley? - has yet to celebrate the Minicomputer and Mainframe eras in a real way. They have done a bit of deep diving into the 50s, but only in the form of standard issue Genius Porn where the computer operators who broke wartime codes were like Harry Potter characters or something, with modern social causes overlaid as a historical corrective of sorts, and I somewhat doubt that Turing is any happier for the fact that the world no longer cares that he was gay, but remains unable to grasp the awesome stuff he did do. He&#x27;s not here for it.<p>Grim thoughts aside, these PDP-8s and the people who worked with them daily deserve a story, complete with looooots of pornographic shots of the machines themselves. Love stories that begin by someone bumping their true love&#x27;s pile of punchcards into a game of &#x27;52 pickup that ends with lurid shots of stacks of cards being sucked into the reader.<p>Anyways, the best story would heroize someone real from the era. I know a lot of stories but cannot really find the one that really deserves someone having a go at making it into a script set in that gorgeous era of earthtoned data.<p>What do you think, HN?",

On the other hand, I&#x27;ve heard that consistency is rewarded regardless of quality (assuming quality is not trash and occasional high quality content is published).<p>What is your experience? And what are some other ways to reach a wider audience?<p>Thanks!<p>[Edit] - Just to clarify 2 things:<p>1. I&#x27;m primarily interested in opinions of people who own their content (i.e. publish on their own website) and not trying to beat some platform algorithm.<p>and<p>2. When I say consistency - I still mean quality, but obviously when you post once a week, the quality will suffer as opposed to posting once a month for example.",

    "text": "At my current company I am a Senior engineer and I have been through three interview loops recently and all concluded that I was not Senior enough. That could be a fair assessment. And if it is, how can I get there? You don&#x27;t know me, but there must be certain ways that are commonly looked for that I am lacking, either in communication or actual technical experience.<p>That&#x27;s the optimistic view on it. The pessimistic view is that in all of these interviews I never perceived that the interviewers were greatly better than my own ability. As one example, walking through my take home project one engineer asked me about a kind of React gotcha. I said I wasn&#x27;t quite sure, and then he admitted that he only just come across that in their own code recently. But I felt like it had already counted against me, even though he himself hadn&#x27;t known about it. I guess it felt like I should have been the perfect version of who they aren&#x27;t yet.",

But sometime she get something similar to panic attacks when she feared something or was not able to do a chore that she used to do. ex: cooking.<p>When I notify about this to doctors they prescribed anti-depressant medication(Duloxetine + Mirtazapine, Venlafaxine), but given those meds, my mom complain that there is burning sensation in body after taking them, so we stopped those meds. It seems to be Dr have miss diagnosed this as depression even though those panic like attacks only occur due to some incident in the environment as I said earlier. Has anyone had similar experience with loved one with PD? If so what did you do?<p>I myself have OCD and recently diagnosed with ADHD, due to undiagnosed ADHD I I am struggling financially, but when I am hearing mom&#x27;s pain I have hard time working.<p>I am aware this is not the place to ask for medical advice. but any advice regarding this matter is highly appreciated!",
